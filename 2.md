It’s not just a drink — it’s a habit, a comfort, and a conversation starter.  
Whether you’re catching up with friends, working late, or traveling by train, a cup of chai fits every mood.

## ☕ Why Chai Matters

Chai has been part of Indian culture for generations.  
It brings warmth to our mornings and calm to our evenings.  

Every sip tells a story — of tea gardens, friendships, and countless “one more cup?” moments.
