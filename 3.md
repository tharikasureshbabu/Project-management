## **Challenges**

Despite the growth, tech startups in Nepal face several challenges:

### **Lack of Clear Regulations**
Outdated legislation makes it difficult for startups to comply with the law. Clear and supportive policies are needed to foster innovation.

### **Access to Funding**
Securing investment is a significant hurdle. Many startups struggle to find the necessary funds to scale their operations.

### **Talent Retention**
The global war for talent means many skilled workers prefer international opportunities. Retaining top talent remains a persistent issue.

### **Market Size**
The domestic market is relatively small, limiting growth potential. Startups often need to look beyond Nepal to sustain their growth.

## **Future Prospects**

The future looks promising with:

### **Increasing Digital Innovation**
The ICT sector is one of the fastest-growing industries in Nepal. Continued innovation and digital transformation are expected.

### **Government Support**
Efforts are being made to create supportive policies for tech-based companies. Initiatives like "Startup Nepal" are a step in the right direction.

### **Global Opportunities**
Many startups are diversifying by taking on international projects. This global outreach helps them grow and innovate.

Nepal's tech ecosystem is on the rise, and with the right support and policies, it has the potential to become a significant player in the global tech industry.
