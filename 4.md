## 🌄 Kutty’s Travel Picks

- **Valparai (Tamil Nadu):** Green hills and quiet tea estates.  
- **Varkala (Kerala):** Calm beaches and cliff views.  
- **Hampi (Karnataka):** Ancient ruins and history that speaks.  
- **Shillong (Meghalaya):** Clouds, music, and charm.

Every trip reminds us — the best journeys aren’t about reaching a place, but finding a piece of ourselves.
