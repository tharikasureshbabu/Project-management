The widespread use of digital wallets has also contributed to economic growth in Nepal.

This has, in turn, boosted consumer spending and encouraged more businesses to adopt digital payment methods.

- **Limited Internet Access**: In some remote areas, limited internet access can hinder the use of digital wallets.
- **User Awareness**: Not all potential users are aware of how to use digital wallets or are hesitant to adopt new technology.
- **Regulatory Issues**: The regulatory framework for digital wallets is still evolving, and ensuring compliance can be challenging.

### **Future Prospects**

The future of digital wallets in Nepal looks promising. As internet access continues to improve and more people become aware of the benefits of digital wallets, their use is expected to grow. Moreover, advancements in technology will likely introduce new features and services, further enhancing the user experience.

## **Conclusion**

Digital wallets like eSewa and Khalti have transformed the way people in Nepal handle financial transactions. By offering convenience, security, and accessibility, these digital wallets have made it easier for individuals to perform a wide range of financial activities.
